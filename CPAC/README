Running the program:
We used Nearpy for the Approximate nearest neighbour (ANN) implementation. To
install nearpy you can simply call - 'pip install nearpy'. 

We used NearPy so that we could pass in a custom-distance metric (in our case
max-norm/Chebyshev distance) for computing the nearest neighbours. Unfortunately,
NearPy seems to be trying to call the distance metric passed in from its own
internal 'nearpy.Distance' subdirectory. We aren't entirely sure why it is set up
this way so we had to modify (hack) the implementation a bit to run correctly. 

Our hack basically loads in Chebyshev Distance as a special distance metric in 
NearPy so that it can access it through its subdirectory structure. 
We tried a few approaches prior to this but ultimately just gave up and 
implemented this hack. We have a script called 'nearpy_setup.sh' implemented
in this folder that just moves some python files to the Nearpy subdirectory
(which should be in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/nearpy/distances). The
script basically copies over an __init__.py file and another max_norm.py file
to the Nearpy installalation directory. You might need 'sudo' access to run the
script (/Library/ is usually write-protected).
